## Systems Conference Deadlines

Countdown timers to keep track of a bunch of systems conference deadlines.

## Adding/updating a conference

To keep things minimal, We are only looking to list top-tier conferences in Systems as per [http://csrankings.org][3]. Feel free to maintain a separate fork if you don't see your sub-field or conference of interest listed.

Forked from [http://aideadlin.es/][2]

To add or update information:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place` attributes
- Send a pull request
